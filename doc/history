History for relman
==================

v0.1.4
-------------------
* running code XFer only when sourcedir != builddir
+ new config option "mkchangelog" to create a ChangeLog (for RPM) out of the
  projects _histfile (as long as that is specified as well and exists)
* edited exit codes and added them also to the man pages

v0.1.3 (19.08.2007)
-------------------
+ added prebuild, postbuild and postrun options (for each package)
+ added "codeget": Optionally obtain the code via "cp", "cvs" or "svn" from
  your source directory - or leave the job to pkgmake. In the first 3 cases,
  you've got the chance to do something on the copy of your code before
  releasing it, but without effect on your original source, when using the
  "prebuild" option.
+ added histfile xfer (to place the file for HistView on the remote machine)
* initial details display no shows "yes/no" instead of "0/1" for the boolean
  options

v0.1.2 (07.08.2007)
-------------------
+ added distribution targets for [s]deb and [s]rpm via scp and ftp
+ added man pages
* reading config in sequence (internal - /etc/relman - ~/.relman/)
+ added missing project-based settings
+ created documented example relman.conf
* first public release

v0.1.1 (03.08.2007)
-------------------
* first usable version (used only internally)
